# Star Wars
This a webapp which displays characters within the The Star Wars universe which I used [SWAPI: The Stars Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) to fetch the data required.


## Details of the app

* To create the app I implemented React app as main ui.
* To fetch data required for the webapp I used React hooks `{useState, useEffect } ` following [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect) .
* I then `props` to pass the data through the components and `map()` to build new element.
* To navigate to character from inside the component I used  `{React Router}`using [react-router-dom]() depedency and I also used `{useParams}` to match and diplay character details.
* To add icon I used [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) dependency.
*  To make the components readadle and to keep my styling in control I added [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) dependency.

## Things to do

* Improving the styling
